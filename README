This is an implementation of a client/server content distribution
network where clients consist of non-interactive reproduction playlists.
The distribution of content is handled using the Chord algorithm (a
distributed hash table).

A web interface developed with yaws-1.68 shows the inner workings of the
DHT.

This code is the result of my Computer Science degree thesis and may be
helpful for people implementing a P2P system in Erlang.
